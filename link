Project Abstract (PMMS–GTU Format)
This project focuses on the development of a web-based E-Commerce application using Spring Boot and Hibernate ORM. The system is designed using the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture, which improves code reusability, scalability, and maintainability. Hibernate is used for database interaction, enabling automatic creation of database and tables at runtime.
The application provides functionalities such as user registration, login authentication, product management, category management, customer management, and admin dashboard. The project follows a layered architecture where DAO classes handle database operations, service classes implement business logic, and controllers manage user requests and responses using ModelAndView.
The system supports MySQL/MariaDB as the backend database and uses Maven for dependency management. Security improvements and bug fixes have been applied to enhance application reliability
